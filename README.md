# Linked List Implementation in C#

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **singly linked list** in C# for educational purposes.


## 🔍 What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (called a "node") contains:
- A **data** value.
- A reference (or link) to the **next node** in the sequence.

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. They are dynamically allocated, making insertion and deletion operations more efficient in certain scenarios.

## 📘 Features Implemented

- ✅ Create a Node class that stores `int` data and a pointer to the next node.
- ✅ Insert new elements at the end of the list.
- ✅ Search for an element in the list (`Contains` method).
- ✅ Print all elements in the list.

## 🧠 Code Structure

### `Node` Class

Defines a node in the linked list.
